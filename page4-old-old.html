        <h3>Congratulations! You just learned to declare variables with a value.</h3>
        <p>Now lets boil water. Here we are doing something. In coding language, a function does something. So boil_water() is a function.

            On the right is a function written for you.</p>

        <div class="showCode"><code contentEditable="false">
            <p>def boil_water():</p>
            <p>  Temp=100C</p>
        </code>
        </div>
        <p>Now this function is for boiling water, but we may use the same action for other dishes. Would it be efficient to rewrite this same function again and again?
            No, right?</p>
        <p>So how about we reuse this same function again?</p>
        <p>On the right we have three quantities of water that you must boil. First one is done for you.
        </p>

        <div class="writeCode" ><code id="codeHere" contentEditable="true" onclick="" >
            <p>#Water = 1 Cup </p>
            <p>Boil_water()
            </p>
            <p># Water = 5ml</p>
            <p># boil in the next line
            </p>

            <p># Water = 1 litre</p>
            <p># boil in the next line
            </p>
