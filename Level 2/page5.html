        Imagine yourself in a masterchef competition.<br>
        You are in a team challenge and cooking a chicken dish. Every member has been assigned a task.<br><br>

        Member A will wash the chicken<br>
        Member B will marinate the washed chicken<br>
        Member C will cook the marinated chicken.<br>

        You notice how Member B’s work is dependent on Member A’s output and Member C’s work is dependent on Member B’s output. If member A doesn’t wash the chicken and give to Member B, member B will have nothing to marinate.
<br>
        Any function that has to return something uses the return statement to return a value.<br><br>

        Let’s see this code<br>
    </p>

    <div class="showCode"><code contentEditable="false">
        <p>def boil():</p>
        <p>    return output</p>
        <p>   </p>
        <p>boiled_water = boil()</p>
       </code>
    </div><br>

    <p>
        Here, boiled_water is a variable that takes the output of the boil() function as a value.<br>
        So now boiled_water variable has boiled water as a value. We can use this boiled water as and when needed.<br>
    </p>
