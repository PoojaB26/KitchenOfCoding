       So there you go. You learn what constants are in a program.

       Now lets get back to boiling.
       So we need water now.

       If I’m making tea for 2 people,
       I will be needing 2 cups of water.

       But when I’m making rice for 4 people,
       I might need 4 glasses of water

       Or when I’m making chutney for 2 people,
       I will need 1 teaspoon of water

       So one dish may require 2 cups of water, another dish may require 5.
       You see, how the quantity could vary?
       In coding language, we can say water is a VARIABLE. It varies for dish to dish.

       Now that you know about variables and constants, can you tell me which of the following is a variable or constant?

       Type 0 for constants and 1 for variables.
       The first one has been done for you

    <div class="writeCode" ><code contentEditable="true" >
        <p>cooking_vessel = 0  </p>
        <p>salt  </p>
        <p>oil  </p>
        <p>serving spoon</p></code>


        <button id="btn" onclick="getCode()">Click</button>
    </div><br>

    <div class="afterClick">
        <h3>Congratulations! You just learned to declare variables with a value.</h3>
        <p>Now lets boil water. Here we are doing something. In coding language, a function does something. So boil_water() is a function.

            On the right is a function written for you.</p>
        <div class="showCode"><code contentEditable="false">
            <p>def boil_water():</p>
            <p>  Temp=100C</p>
        </code>
        </div>
        <p>Now this function is for boiling water, but we may use the same action for other dishes. Would it be efficient to rewrite this same function again and again?
            No, right?</p>
        <p>So how about we reuse this same function again?</p>
        <p>On the right we have three quantities of water that you must boil. First one is done for you.
        </p>
        <div class="writeCode" ><code id="codeHere" contentEditable="true" onclick="" >
            <p>##Water = 1 Cup </p>
            <p>Boil_water()
            </p>
            <p>## Water = 5ml</p>
            <p>## boil in the next line
            </p>

            <p>## Water = 1 litre</p>
            <p>## boil in the next line
            </p>
