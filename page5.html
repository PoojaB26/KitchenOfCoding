    <p>But did you notice this following line of code?</p>
    <div class="showCode"><code contentEditable="false">
        <p> #Quantity is in ml</p>
    </code>
    </div><br>

    <p>

        When you are reading a recipe, there are few footnotes or comments or instructions before the main recipe. In the same way, if we want to add a comment or instruction to our code, we can use # to write anything we want. We call it a comment.

        When somebody reads your recipe, these sidenotes help other readers to understand your recipe better.
        In the same way when someone reads your code, these comments help them to understand what you are trying to do in the code.

        Let’s show you an example of how comments are used in coding

    </p>
    <div class="showCode"><code contentEditable="false">
        <p>#constants to use for boiling water</p>
        <p>Stove = 1</p>
        <p>Cooking_vessel = 1</p><br>

        <p>#variables to use for boiling water</p>
        <p>#quantity is in litre</p>
        <p>Water = 3</p><br><br>

        <p>#now boil the water in 100C</p>
        <p>boil_water()</p><br><br>

        <p>#hot water is ready. Printing it here</p>
        <p>Print(water)</p><br><br>

        <p>#Announce to everyone that boiling water is successful</p>
        <p>print(“Boiling water is successful”)</p><br><br>

    </code>
    </div><br>
    <p>
        Notice how we explain the major steps with comments. So that later on when you stumble upon your code, you are not completely lost or confused

        Note: Comments are never printed on screen. It’s only for the coder to see. Just how recipe instructions are just for the chef to know.

        Why dont you print something to test the knowledge you just got?
        The instructions are given in the comments.
