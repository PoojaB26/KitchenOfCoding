# Kitchen Of Coding
Kitchen of Coding, born at Mozilla #helloweb hackathon 2016 organised by the Mozilla community, is an online interactive platform, that aims to teach programming concepts and languages to home-makers and housewives, in the form of recipes.<br>

## Features 
* **Introduction to Python** - Python is a great first language because of its simple grammar and how close it is to the English language. 

* **Programming concepts divided into levels** - At the moment, we have curated content for 10 levels where each level teaches a couple of new OOP concepts along with basic Python syntax.

* **Online Python interpreter** - Students can test their code in an inbrowser interpreter of Python, built by Skulpt

* **Scores!** - Score system to motivate student users!
