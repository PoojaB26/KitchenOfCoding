       So there you go. You learn what constants are in a program.

       Now lets get back to boiling.
       So we need water now.

       If I’m making tea for 2 people,
       I will be needing 2 cups of water.

       But when I’m making rice for 4 people,
       I might need 4 glasses of water

       Or when I’m making chutney for 2 people,
       I will need 1 teaspoon of water

       So one dish may require 2 cups of water, another dish may require 5.
       You see, how the quantity could vary?
       In coding language, we can say water is a VARIABLE. It varies for dish to dish.

       Now that you know about variables and constants, can you tell me which of the following is a variable or constant?

       Type 0 for constants and 1 for variables.
       The first one has been done for you
